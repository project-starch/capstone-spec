*an exception is raised when any of the following conditions is met:*

****
- `Unexpected operand type (24)`
* `x[rs1]` is not a capability.
- `Illegal operand value (29)`
* `imm` does not correspond to the encoding of a valid CCSR.
****

*If no exception is raised:*

====
. If the link:#ccsr-man-constr[read constraint] is satisfied
- The content of the CCSR specified by `imm` is written to `x[rd]`.
- If `x[rd].type` is not `1` (non-linear), write `cnull` to the CCSR specified by `imm`.
. Otherwise, write `cnull` to `x[rd]`.
. If the link:#ccsr-man-constr[write constraint] is satisfied
- Write `x[rs1]` to the CCSR specified by `imm`.
- If `x[rs1].type` is not `1` (non-linear), write `cnull` to `x[rs1]`.
. Otherwise, preserve the current content of the CCSR specified by `imm`.
