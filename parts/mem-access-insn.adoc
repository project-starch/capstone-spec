= Memory Access Instructions

Capstone provides instructions to load from and store to memory regions using capabilities.

== Load/Store with Capabilities

Capstone offers a set of instructions for loading and storing integers of various sizes
using capabilities.

[#load-with-cap]
=== Load

The LDD, LDW, LDH, LDB instructions load an integer in the size of doubleword, word, 
halfword, and byte respectively.
In Capstone, a doubleword is defined as `XLENBYTES` bytes, a word, halfword, and byte 
are defined as `XLENBYTES/2`, `XLENBYTES/4`, and `XLENBYTES/8` bytes respectively.

*An exception is raised when any of the following conditions are met:*

* `rs1` does not contain a capability.
* The `type` field of the capability in `rs1` is neither `0` (linear) nor `1` (non-linear).
* The `valid` field of the capability in `rs1` is `0` (invalid).
* The `perms` field of the capability in `rs1` is `0` (no access).

and `end` fields of the capability in `rs1`, and the `cursor` field of the capability in `rs1` is
not in the range `[base, end-size]` (i.e., `cursor < base` or `cursor > end-size`), where `size`
is the size (in bytes) of the integer being loaded.
* The `cursor` field of the capability in `rs1` is not aligned to the size of the integer being loaded.

*If no exception is raised:* Load the content at the memory location `[cursor, cursor + size)` as an integer,
where `cursor` is the `cursor` field of the capability in `rs1` and `size` is the size of the integer
(i.e., `XLENBYTES`, `XLENBYTES/2`, `XLENBYTES/4`, or `XLENBYTES/8` bytes for LDD, LDW, LDH, and LDB respectively), to `rd`.

[#store-with-cap]

*An exception is raised when any of the following conditions are met:*

* `rs1` does not contain a capability.
* The `type` field of the capability in `rs1` is not `0`, `1`, or `3` (linear, non-linear, or uninitialized).
* The `valid` field of the capability in `rs1` is `0` (invalid).
* The `perms` field of the capability in `rs1` is not `3` or `4` (read-write or read-write-execute).
* The bound of the capability in `rs1` is `[base, end)`, where `base` and `end` are the `base`
and `end` fields of the capability in `rs1`, and the `cursor` field of the capability in `rs1` is
not in the range `[base, end-size]` (i.e., `cursor < base` or `cursor > end-size`), where `size`
is the size (in bytes) of the integer being loaded.
* The `cursor` field of the capability in `rs1` is not aligned to the size of the scalar value being loaded.
* `rs2` does not contain an integer.

*If no exception is raised:* Store the integer in `rs2` to the memory location `[cursor, cursor + size)`,
where `cursor` is the `cursor` field of the capability in `rs1` and `size` is the size of the integer
(i.e., `XLENBYTES`, `XLENBYTES/2`, `XLENBYTES/4`, or `XLENBYTES/8` bytes for STD, STW, STH, and STB respectively).
The `cursor` field of the capability in `rs1` is set to `cursor + size`. The data contained in the `CLEN`-bit aligned
memory location `[cbase, cend)`, which alias with memory location `[cursor, cursor + size)`
(i.e., `cbase = cursor & ~(CLENBYTES - 1)` and `cend = cbase + CLENBYTES`), will be interpreted as an integer type.

== Load/Store Capabilities

In Capstone, two specific instructions (i.e., LDC and LTC) are used to load and store capabilities.

[#load-cap]
=== Load Capabilities

The LDC instruction loads a capability from memory.

.LDC instruction format

....
{reg: [
    {bits: 7, name: '0b1011011'},
    {bits: 5, name: 'rd (C)' },
    {bits: 3, name: '0b001' },
    {bits: 5, name: 'rs1 (C)' },
    {bits: 5, name: '*' },
    {bits: 7, name: '0b0010000' }
]}
....

*An exception is raised when any of the following conditions are met:*

* `rs1` does not contain a capability.
* The `type` field of the capability in `rs1` is neither `0` (linear) nor `1` (non-linear).
* The `valid` field of the capability in `rs1` is `0` (invalid).
* The `perms` field of the capability in `rs1` is `0` (no access).
* The bound of the capability in `rs1` is `[base, end)`, where `base` and `end` are the `base`
and `end` fields of the capability in `rs1`, and the `cursor` field of the capability in `rs1` is
not in the range `[base, end-CLENBYTES]` (i.e., `cursor < base` or `cursor > end-CLENBYTES`).
* The `cursor` field of the capability in `rs1` is not aligned to `CLEN` bits.
* The data contained in the memory location `[cursor, cursor + CLENBYTES)`, where `cursor` is the `cursor`
field of the capability in `rs1`, is not a capability.
* The capability being loaded is not a non-linear capability (i.e., `type != 1`), and the `perms` field of
the capability in `rs1` is not `3` or `4` (read-write or read-write-execute).

*If no exception is raised:* Load the capability at the memory location `[cursor, cursor + CLENBYTES)`, where `cursor`
is the `cursor` field of the capability in `rs1`, into `rd`. If the capability being loaded is not a non-linear
capability (i.e., `type != 1`), the data contained in the memory location `[cursor, cursor + CLENBYTES)` will be
set to the content of `cnull`.

[#store-cap]
=== Store Capabilities

The STC instruction stores a capability to memory.

{reg: [
    {bits: 7, name: '0b1011011'},
    {bits: 5, name: '*' },

    {bits: 5, name: 'rs1 (C)' },
    {bits: 5, name: 'rs2 (C)' },

*An exception is raised when any of the following conditions are met:*

* `rs1` does not contain a capability.
* The `type` field of the capability in `rs1` is not `0`, `1`, or `3` (linear, non-linear, or uninitialized).
* The `valid` field of the capability in `rs1` is `0` (invalid).
* The `perms` field of the capability in `rs1` is not `3` or `4` (read-write or read-write-execute).
* The bound of the capability in `rs1` is `[base, end)`, where `base` and `end` are the `base`
and `end` fields of the capability in `rs1`, and the `cursor` field of the capability in `rs1` is
not in the range `[base, end-CLENBYTES]` (i.e., `cursor < base` or `cursor > end-CLENBYTES`).
* The `cursor` field of the capability in `rs1` is not aligned to `CLEN` bits.
* `rs2` does not contain a capability.

*If no exception is raised:* Store the capability in `rs2` to the memory location `[cursor, cursor + CLENBYTES)`,
where `cursor` is the `cursor` field of the capability in `rs1`. The `cursor` field of the capability in `rs1`
is set to `cursor + CLENBYTES`. If the capability in `rs2` is not a non-linear capability (i.e., `type != 1`),
`rs2` will be set to the content of `cnull`.

== _TransCapstone_ Added Instructions

In _TransCapstone_, besides the LDC and STC instructions, two additional instructions (i.e., LDCR and STCR)
are added to load and store capabilities from/to the normal memory using raw addresses. These 2 instructions
are only available in _TransCapstone_ and an exception will be raised if they are executed in _Pure Capstone_.

[#load-cap-raw]
=== Load with Raw Addresses

The LDCR instruction loads a capability from the normal memory using raw addresses.

.LDCR instruction format

{reg: [
    {bits: 7, name: '0b1011011'},
    {bits: 5, name: 'rd (C)' },
    {bits: 3, name: '0b001' },
    {bits: 5, name: 'rs1 (I)' },
    {bits: 5, name: '*' },
    {bits: 7, name: '0b0011010' }
]}

*An exception is raised when any of the following conditions are met:*

* `rs1` does not contain an integer.
* The integer in `rs1` is not aligned to `CLEN` bits.
* The integer in `rs1` is in the range `[SBASE, SEND)` (i.e., `SBASE \<= rs1 < SEND`).
* The data contained in the memory location `[rs1, rs1 + CLENBYTES)` is not a capability.

*If no exception is raised:* Load the capability at the memory location `[rs1, rs1 + CLENBYTES)` into `rd`.
If the capability being loaded is a non-linear capability (i.e. `type != 1`), the data contained in the
memory location `[rs1, rs1 + CLENBYTES)` will be set to the content of `cnull`.

[#store-cap-raw]
=== Store with Raw Addresses

The STCR instruction stores a capability to the normal memory using raw addresses.

.STCR instruction format

    {bits: 5, name: 'rs1 (I)' },
    {bits: 5, name: 'rs2 (C)' },
    {bits: 7, name: '0b0011011' }

* The integer in `rs1` is not aligned to `CLEN` bits.
* The integer in `rs1` is in the range `[SBASE, SEND)` (i.e., `SBASE \<= rs1 < SEND`).
* `rs2` does not contain a capability.

*If no exception is raised:* Store the capability in `rs2` to the memory location `[rs1, rs1 + CLENBYTES)`.
If the capability in `rs2` is not a non-linear capability (i.e., `type != 1`), `rs2` will be set to the
content of `cnull`.
