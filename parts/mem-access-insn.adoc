= Memory Access Instructions

Capstone provides instructions to load from and store to memory regions using capabilities.

[#load-store-with-cap]
== Load/Store with Capabilities

Capstone offers a set of instructions for loading and storing integers of various sizes
using capabilities.

*Load:*

The LDD, LDW, LDH, LDB instructions load an integer in the size of doubleword, word, 
halfword, and byte respectively.
In Capstone, a doubleword is defined as `XLEN` bits, a word, halfword, and byte 
are defined as `XLEN/2`, `XLEN/4`, and `XLEN/8` bits respectively.

*An exception is raised when any of the following conditions are met:*

* `rs1` does not contain a capability.
* The `type` field of the capability in `rs1` is neither `0` (linear) nor `1` (non-linear).
* The `valid` field of the capability in `rs1` is `0` (invalid).
* The `perms` field of the capability in `rs1` is `0` (no access).
* The bound of the capability in `rs1` is `[base, end)`, where `base` and `end` are the `base`
and `end` fields of the capability in `rs1`, and the `cursor` field of the capability in `rs1` is
not in the range `[base, end-size)` (i.e., `cursor < base` or `cursor >= end-size`), where `size`
is the size of the integer being loaded.
* The `cursor` field of the capability in `rs1` is not aligned to the size of the integer being loaded.

*If no exception is raised:* Load the content at the memory location `[cursor, cursor + size)` as an integer,
where `cursor` is the `cursor` field of the capability in `rs1` and `size` is the size of the integer
(i.e., `XLEN`, `XLEN/2`, `XLEN/4`, or `XLEN/8` bits for LDD, LDW, LDH, and LDB respectively), to `rd`.

*An exception is raised when any of the following conditions are met:*

* `rs1` does not contain a capability.
* The `type` field of the capability in `rs1` is not `0`, `1`, or `3` (linear, non-linear, or uninitialized).
* The `valid` field of the capability in `rs1` is `0` (invalid).
* The `perms` field of the capability in `rs1` is not `3` or `4` (read-write or read-write-execute).
* The bound of the capability in `rs1` is `[base, end)`, where `base` and `end` are the `base`
and `end` fields of the capability in `rs1`, and the `cursor` field of the capability in `rs1` is
not in the range `[base, end-size)` (i.e., `cursor < base` or `cursor >= end-size`), where `size`
is the size of the integer being loaded.
* The `cursor` field of the capability in `rs1` is not aligned to the size of the scalar value being loaded.
* `rs2` does not contain an integer.

*If no exception is raised:* Store the integer in `rs2` to the memory location `[cursor, cursor + size)`,
where `cursor` is the `cursor` field of the capability in `rs1` and `size` is the size of the integer
(i.e., `XLEN`, `XLEN/2`, `XLEN/4`, or `XLEN/8` bits for STD, STW, STH, and STB respectively). The `cursor`
field of the capability in `rs1` is set to `cursor + size`. The data contained in the `CLEN`-bit aligned
memory location `[cbase, cend)`, which alias with memory location `[cursor, cursor + size)`
(i.e., `cbase = cursor & ~(CLEN - 1)` and `cend = cbase + CLEN`), will be interpreted as an integer type.

[#load-store-cap]
== Load/Store Capabilities

In Capstone, two specific instructions (i.e., LDC and LTC) are used to load and store capabilities.

*LDC:*

The LDC instruction loads a capability from memory.

{reg: [
    {bits: 7, name: '0b1011011'},
    {bits: 5, name: 'rd (C)' },

    {bits: 5, name: 'rs1 (C)' },
    {bits: 5, name: '*' },
    {bits: 7, name: '0b0010000' }

*An exception is raised when any of the following conditions are met:*

* `rs1` does not contain a capability.
* The `type` field of the capability in `rs1` is neither `0` (linear) nor `1` (non-linear).
* The `valid` field of the capability in `rs1` is `0` (invalid).
* The `perms` field of the capability in `rs1` is `0` (no access).
* The bound of the capability in `rs1` is `[base, end)`, where `base` and `end` are the `base`
and `end` fields of the capability in `rs1`, and the `cursor` field of the capability in `rs1` is
not in the range `[base, end-CLEN)` (i.e., `cursor < base` or `cursor >= end-CLEN`).
* The `cursor` field of the capability in `rs1` is not aligned to `CLEN` bits.
* The data contained in the memory location `[cursor, cursor + CLEN)`, where `cursor` is the `cursor`
field of the capability in `rs1`, is not a capability.
* The capability being loaded is not a non-linear capability (i.e., `type != 1`), and the `perms` field of
the capability in `rs1` is not `3` or `4` (read-write or read-write-execute).

*If no exception is raised:* Load the capability at the memory location `[cursor, cursor + CLEN)`, where `cursor`
is the `cursor` field of the capability in `rs1`, into `rd`. If the capability being loaded is a linear capability,
the data contained in the memory location `[cursor, cursor + CLEN)` will be set to the content of `cnull`.

*STC:*

The STC instruction stores a capability to memory.

* The `type` field of the capability in `rs1` is not `0`, `1`, or `3` (linear, non-linear, or uninitialized).
* The `valid` field of the capability in `rs1` is `0` (invalid).
* The `perms` field of the capability in `rs1` is not `3` or `4` (read-write or read-write-execute).
* The bound of the capability in `rs1` is `[base, end)`, where `base` and `end` are the `base`
and `end` fields of the capability in `rs1`, and the `cursor` field of the capability in `rs1` is
not in the range `[base, end-CLEN)` (i.e., `cursor < base` or `cursor >= end-CLEN`).
* The `cursor` field of the capability in `rs1` is not aligned to `CLEN` bits.
* `rs2` does not contain a capability.

*If no exception is raised:* Store the capability in `rs2` to the memory location `[cursor, cursor + CLEN)`,
where `cursor` is the `cursor` field of the capability in `rs1`. The `cursor` field of the capability in `rs1`
is set to `cursor + CLEN`.
