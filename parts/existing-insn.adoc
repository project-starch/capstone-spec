= Adjustments to Existing Instructions

For most existing instructions in {base_isa_name}, the adjustments are straightforward.
Their behaviour is unchanged, and an exception is raised if any of the operands
(i.e., `x[rs1]`, `x[rs2]` or `x[rd]`) is a capability.
Apart from this operand constraint, the following instructions in {base_isa_name} are adjusted in {proj_name}:

* For memory access instructions, they are extended to use capabilities as addresses for memory access.
* For control flow instructions, they are slightly adjusted to support capability-aware control flow.

[#load-store]
== Memory Access Instructions

In {base_isa_name}, memory access instructions include load instructions
(i.e., `lb`, `lh`, `lw`, `lbu`, `lhu`, `lwu`, `ld`), and store instructions (i.e., `sb`, `sh`, `sw`, `sd`).
In {base_isa_name}, these instructions take an integer as a raw address, and load or store a value from/to this address.
In {proj_name}, these instructions are extended to take a capability as an address.

=== _{isa_var_pure}_

==== Load Instructions

In _{isa_var_pure}_, {base_isa_name} load instructions are modified to load integers of different
sizes using capabilities.

===== Signed Load Instructions

`lb`, `lh`, `lw`, `ld` instructions are modified to load an integer in the size of byte, halfword, word, and doubleword
(i.e., `XLENBYTES/8`, `XLENBYTES/4`, `XLENBYTES/2`, and `XLENBYTES` bytes), using capabilities respectively.
The loaded integer is sign-extended to the size of the destination register (i.e., `XLEN` bits).

*An exception is raised when any of the following conditions are met:*

* `x[rs1]` is not a capability.
* `x[rs1].type` is not `0`, `1`, or `3` (linear, non-linear, or uninitialised).

`[x[rs1].cursor + imm, x[rs1].cursor + imm + size)`, where `size` is the size of the integer being stored
(i.e., `XLENBYTES/8`, `XLENBYTES/4`, `XLENBYTES/2`, and `XLENBYTES` bytes for `sb`, `sh`, `sw`, and `sd` respectively).
If `x[rs1].type` is `3` (uninitialised), `x[rs1].cursor` is set to `x[rs1].cursor + size`.
The content in the `CLEN`-bit aligned memory location `[cbase, cend)`, which alias with memory location
`[x[rs1].cursor + imm, x[rs1].cursor + imm + size)`, is set to integer type,
where `cbase = (cursor + imm) & ~(CLENBYTES - 1)` and `cend = cbase + CLENBYTES`.

=== _{isa_var_hybrid}_

In _{isa_var_hybrid}_, {base_isa_name} memory access instructions behave the same as in _{isa_var_pure}_
if `cwld` is `1` (secure world). However, if `cwld` is `0` (normal world), these instructions behave
differently in different _encoding modes_.

* When `cwld` is `0` (normal world) and `emode` is `1` (capability encoding mode), these instructions
behave the same as in _{isa_var_pure}_.
* When `cwld` is `0` (normal world) and `emode` is `0` (integer encoding mode), these instructions
behave the same as in {base_isa_name} except that the following adjustments are made to these instructions:
** An exception is raised if any of `x[rs1]`, `x[rs2]` and `x[rd]` contains a capability.
** An exception is raised if the address to be accessed (i.e., `x[rs1] + imm`) is within
the range `(SBASE - size, SEND)`, where `size` is the size (in bytes) of the integer to be loaded/stored.

== Control Flow Instructions

In {base_isa_name}, conditional branch instructions (i.e., `beq`, `bne`, `blt`, `bge`, `bltu`, and `bgeu`),
and unconditional jump instructions (i.e., `jal` and `jalr`) are used to control the flow of execution.
In {proj_name}, these instructions are adjusted to support the situation where the program counter is a capability.
