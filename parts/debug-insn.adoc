== World Switching

The instructions SETWORLD and ONPARTITION are related to world switching
in TransCapstone-RISC-V. SETWORLD directly sets the core to the specified
world (`1` for secure world, and `0` for normal world) without any other
side effect. ONPARTITION switches on (`1`) or off (`0`) the world partitioning
in memory.
